# Disease-Mortality-Prediction


### Hepatitis Mortality Prediction

In this project we built an end to end data science pipeline for Hepatitis mortality predicition from scratch. We present three machine learning models and do a comparitive analysis. We have outlined all the major insights at each step in the form of narratives. 

The entire process is productionized with the help of streamlit. We have built a complete machine learning web app using Streamlit and Python for Hepatitis Mortality Prediction. 

A demom version of this app can be seen in Youtube in this link: https://youtu.be/uoqxDJr7UZ8. Kindly watch this video to get an idea of the app.

The steps followed for this project are clearly outlined below:
